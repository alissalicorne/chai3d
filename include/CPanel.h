\class      cPanel
\brief      This class represents a rectangular panel that can be displayed
            within a CHAI viewport, and it is intended to be added to the 
            front and back 2d rendering trees within the camera class.
            It generally behaves like a cMesh (from which it subclasses),
            you can give it colors, materials, textures, etc.  It can also be
            used as a 3D rectangle, although its primary purpose is for 2D
            rendering.
