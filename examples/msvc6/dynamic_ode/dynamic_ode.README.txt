 CHAI Example: dynamic_ode

This example connects CHAI with ODE (Open Dynamics Engine), an 
open-source physics engine (www.ode.org) that allows for the easy 
creation of dynamic virtual worlds.  In addition, this example shows 
how to use two devices within the same world.  (Enabling the second 
device is done by clicking the "Enable second device" button, so it 
can also be run with just one device.) This example lets the user 
push around a box in a small room, similar to the SensAble Dice demo.  

The ODE library is in the lib folder within the msvc6 example folder, 
and the include files are in the include folder.

The cMesh, class is subclassed as cODEMesh in separate files in order 
to connect the CHAI mesh to ODE objects.  This is an example of how 
you can extend CHAI through subclassing.
