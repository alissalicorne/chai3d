 CHAI Example: activex
 
 Author: Chris Sewell

****/

This example demonstrates the use of CHAI in an ActiveX control,
which can be embedded in an .html page.  The core functionality
is very similar to the 'basic_shapes' example: a simple environment
is rendered via graphic and haptic callbacks to a central application
class.  In this case, that class is embedded in an ActiveX
control.

The provided project compiles to an .ocx file (an ActiveX control)
in the 'bin' directory, and an .html file is provided in that
directory as well, for testing the control.

We have not built a full installer for the activex control.  It should
be installed automatically if you compile the control from source.  If
you want to test the provided binary, cd into the 'bin' directory and
run:

regsvr32 active_x.ocx

This will tell Windows about this control.  You can then open the .htm
file in Internet Explorer (FireFox doesn't support ActiveX) and you should
see the CHAI cube.
