      \class      cSound
      \brief      cSound plays sounds based on frequencies, amplitudes,
                  and attenuations from a data file, based on the algorithm
                  by Kies Van den Doel K and Dinesh Pai in "The sounds of
                  physical shapes". Presence 1998, 7(4): 382-395, and
                  "The AHI: An Audio and Haptic Interface For Contact
                  Interactions" by DiFilippo and Pai.  Sample
                  data files for a bell and a teapot are in this directory.
