 CHAI Example: 01_basic_shapes
 
 Author: Francois Conti

****/

This example demonstrates the use of the core CHAI components by 
creating an OpenGL environment and allowing the user to render
a simple object graphically and haptically.

Relevant items to look at in the code are :

* main.cpp is the main application file, which includes
  initialization and the haptic and graphic rendering loops.

  Useful functions to look at are :

  * TForm1::FormCreate(TObject *Sender): Here we create a CHAI world, 
    a viewport on that world, a camera, and a simple shape (a cube).

  * Form1::Timer1Timer(TObject *Sender): This is called at intervals of
    20 msec (as specified in the properites of the Timer object on the
    main form) and renders the scene graphically.

  * HapticLoop(): This is called by the haptics thread at each haptic 
    iteration, and it tells the haptic device to render forces.

  * TForm1::ToggleHapticsButtonClick(TObject *Sender): This is called when 
    the user clicks the 'Haptics' button, and it enables haptic rendering.

  * TForm1::updateCameraPosition(): This changes the field of view, 
    position, and orientation of the camera, depending on the user's mouse   
    movements.
