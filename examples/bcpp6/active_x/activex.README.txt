 CHAI Example: activex

This example demonstrates the use of CHAI in an ActiveX control,
which can be embedded in an .html page.  The core functionality
is very similar to the 'basic_shapes' example: a simple environment
is rendered via graphic and haptic callbacks to a central application
class.  In this case, that class is embedded in an ActiveX
control.

The provided project compiles to an .ocx file (an ActiveX control)
in the 'bin' directory, and an .html file is provided in that
directory as well, for testing the control.  Note that you must
register the component (i.e., by choosing Run->Register Active X
Server in Borland) before it will work on your computer.
