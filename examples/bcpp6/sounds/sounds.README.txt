 CHAI Example: sounds
 
 Author: Chris Sewell

****/

This example generates sounds based on frequencies, amplitudes,
and decay coefficients from a data file, convolved with the
haptic normal force, based on the algorithm
by Kies Van den Doel K and Dinesh Pai in "The sounds of
physical shapes". Presence 1998, 7(4): 382-395, and
"The AHI: An Audio and Haptic Interface For Contact
Interactions" by DiFilippo and Pai.  Sample data files for 
a bell and a teapot are in this directory.

If the sound doesn't sound right on your machine, try adjusting 
the following constants at the top of CSound.cpp: 

// Sample rate; decrease (perhaps to 22000 or so) if sound is jerky
#define SAMPLE_RATE 44100

// Buffer size; decrease (perhaps to 128 or so) if there is a perceptable pause
// between impact and initiation of sound
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024

// Number of samples generated per impact; decrease in proportion to SAMPLE_RATE
// if you decrease that; increase (decrease) if sound fades too quickly (too slowly)
#define MAX_SAMPLES_PER_IMPACT 200000
