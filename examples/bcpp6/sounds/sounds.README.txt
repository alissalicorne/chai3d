This example plays sounds based on frequencies, amplitudes,
and decay coefficients from a data file, based on the algorithm
by Kies Van den Doel K and Dinesh Pai in "The sounds of
physical shapes". Presence 1998, 7(4): 382-395, and
"The AHI: An Audio and Haptic Interface For Contact
Interactions" by DiFilippo and Pai.  Sample data files for
