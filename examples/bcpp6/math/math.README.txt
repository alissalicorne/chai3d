This example demonstrates some of the functionality of the
built-in matrix and vector classes.  You can enter any
numbers into any of the three matrices (M0, M1, and MR) or
vectors (V0, V1, and VR).  Pressing the buttons performs
the indicated operations.  The results are stored as indicated;
in most cases, this is in VR for vector results and MR for
matrix results.  Scalar results (such as length of a vector)
appear in the text field in the Vector Operations group box.

In the code, the function TForm2::readValues() reads the
current values of the matrices and vectors from the screen and 
stores them in the matrix and vector variables.  The function
TForm2::updateDisplay() writes the values of these variables to
the screen.  The TForm2::ButtonXClick(...) functions perform the
indicated operation when Button X is pushed (where X is an
integer).  

Thus, to see how to perform a specific matrix or vector operation 
in CHAI, you can examine the code in the handler for the button
labeled with the desired operation.
