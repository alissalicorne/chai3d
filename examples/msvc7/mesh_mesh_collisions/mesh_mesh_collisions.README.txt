 CHAI Example: mesh_mesh_collisions
 
 Author: Chris Sewell

This example allows the user to control the position and rotation of
a mesh using the haptic device, and detects collisions between this
mesh and other meshes of the world.  The tool mesh is yellow when
not in collision and red when it is in collision with another mesh.
The algorithm makes use of the CHAI sphere trees as well as Tomas
Moller's triangle-triangle primitive intersection algorithm.  It can
return all pairs of colliding triangles or just one pair (based on
the checkbox).  This example currently provides no force feedback; the
tool mesh just changes color when it is in collision.
