 CHAI Example: dynamic_meshes
 
 Author: Chris Sewell

This example connects CHAI with ODE (Open Dynamics Engine), an 
open-source physics engine (www.ode.org) that allows for the easy 
creation of dynamic virtual worlds.  

When you run the demo, push the space bar to drop additional
meshes (by default bunnies) from the sky.  You can push them
around.
