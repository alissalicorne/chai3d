This example demonstrates a somewhat simplified implementation of
the force shading algorithm described in Section 4 of "The Haptic 
Display of Complex Graphical Environments" by Diego Ruspini, 
Krasimir Kolarov, and Oussama Khatib, SIGGRAPH 1997, pp. 345-352.
Force shading can be toggled on and off with the checkbox.
