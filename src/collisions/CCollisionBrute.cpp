    Check if the given line segment intersects any triangle of the mesh. This
    method is called "brute force" because all triangles are checked by
    invoking their collision-detection methods.  This method is simple but very
    inefficient.

              cVector3d& a_segmentPointB, cGenericObject*& a_colObject,
              cTriangle*& a_colTriangle, cVector3d& a_colPoint,
              double& a_colSquareDistance, int a_proxyCall)
    \param    a_segmentPointA  Initial point of segment.
    \param    a_segmentPointB  End point of segment.
    \param    a_colObject  Returns pointer to nearest collided object.
    \param    a_colTriangle Returns pointer to nearest collided triangle.
    \param    a_colPoint  Returns position of nearest collision.
    \param    a_colSquareDistance  Returns distance between ray origin and
                                   collision point.
    \param    a_proxyCall  If this is > 0, this is a call from a proxy, and the
                           value of a_proxyCall specifies which call this is.
                           When checking for the second and third constraint
                           planes, only the neighbors of the triangle intersected
                           in the first call need be checked, not the whole tree.
                           Call with a_proxyCall = -1 for non-proxy calls.
    \return   Return true if the line segment intersects a triangle.
