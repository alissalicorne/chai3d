This file is way out of date, so I'm re-writing it to just include things that we've had on our horizon for a while.  Please add to this file as you see fit; we'll discuss it at some future CHAI meeting.

* Important examples I'd really like to see:

  * Rendering with a tool that isn't just a dot, i.e. a nice mesh
    that rotates with the device.

  * An example with any kind of networking

  * An example where you can grab an object and move it around, a la
    dice.

  * An example that uses the .net framework

  * An example with deformable objects

* Unit test scripts

* Shadows
