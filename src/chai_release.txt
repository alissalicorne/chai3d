To release a version of chai (this usually takes about a half-hour, almost
all of which is compilation time) :

* Make sure that the changelog is appropriately up-to-date, and
  add a 'released version x.xx' to the top of it.

* Open the msvc7 example solution file and do a batch rebuild.
  All the release versions should be selected.  This will build the
  CHAI libraries too.  Leave object_loader as the active project.
  Make the solution window look pretty by closing all open documents
  and all open project folders.

* Open the msvc6 example solution file and build chai3d_complete.
  Then do a batch rebuild; all the release versions should be selected.
  Leave object_loader as the active project.  Make the solution window look
  pretty by closing all open documents and all open project folders.

* Open the Borland example project group.  Make sure all the projects
  and libs are set to _release_ mode and do a 'build all' (not 'make
  all').  This includes all the CHAI lib files.

* Close all your IDE's.

* Make sure that all the .exe and .ocx files in the bin 
  directory are dated correctly; i.e. make sure they actually
  got re-built since you started this process.

* Test all the binaries if this is going to be a 'stable' release.
  This step gets skipped for a 'beta' release.  If it's a 'beta' release,
  at least test a few things as a sanity check.

* Open doxygen and load the doc/doxyfile.  Run doxygen.

* Use windows search to find all files with these extensions and remove
  them:

  *.pch;*.pchi;*.obj;*.idb;*.pdb;*.tds;*.~*;BuildLog.*;*.dg;*.#*

  ...except for turntable.obj and other actual model files!

  [FYI you can paste the above string into Windows find...]

  Also search for directories called VTune, Release and Debug, and remove them too.

  Also search for files greater than 50k and make sure there's nothing that
  doesn't belong.

  Delete the intel lib file if you've compiled it.

* Zip the top-level directory (should be called chai3d) up into
  chai3d[vx.xx].zip .  The zipfile should be around 20MB.

* Open the zipfile and remove 'chai_todo.txt' from the source directory; this
  contains internal todo's that the world doesn't need to see.  Also remove
  all directories called "CVS".

* ftp the zipfile to the CHAI 'builds' directory

* Remove the entire doc/html directory online and upload the new doxygen docs.

* Edit the chai3d.html file to include all the important notes in
  the changelog since the last release.

* Check everything into CVS so everyone else can access the current CHAI via
  CVS.

* E-mail the rest of the team so we can go online and confirm that everything
  works.  It's very likely that something will be wrong, which is why everyone
  should check up on it ASAP.
