To release a version of chai (this usually takes about a half-hour, almost
all of which is compilation time) :

* Make sure that the changelog is appropriately up-to-date, and
  add a 'released version x.xx' to the top of it.

* If there are new examples, update the examples.html file in the 
  bin directory, following the form used for the other examples.

* Open the msvc7 example solution file and do a batch rebuild.
  All the release versions should be selected.  This will build the
  CHAI libraries too.  Leave object_loader or chai_complete as the
  active project.  Make the solution window look pretty by closing all
  open documents and all open project folders.

* Open the msvc6 example solution file and build chai3d_complete.
  Then do a batch rebuild; all the release versions should be selected.
  Leave object_loader as the active project.  Make the solution window look
  pretty by closing all open documents and all open project folders.

* [Optional]: Open the msvc7_intel .icproj file and build the Intel version
  of CHAI.

* Open a cygwin shell and cd into the examples/cygwin directory.  Run
  the build_cygwin_examples script, which will forcibly rebuild CHAI and
  all the cygwin examples.

* Open the Borland example project group.  Make sure all the projects
  and libs are set to _release_ mode and do a 'build all' (not 'make
  all').  This includes all the CHAI lib files.

* Close all your IDE's.

* Make sure that all the .exe and .ocx files in the bin 
  directory are dated correctly; i.e. make sure they actually
  got re-built since you started this process.

* Test all the binaries if this is going to be a 'stable' release.
  This step gets skipped for a 'beta' release.  If it's a 'beta' release,
  at least test a few things as a sanity check.

* Open doxygen and load the doc/doxyfile.  Run doxygen.  Be sure to update
  the release #.  Fix any errors logged by doxygen.

* Use windows search to find all files with these extensions and remove
  them:

  *.pch;*.pchi;*.obj;*.idb;*.pdb;*.tds;*.~*;BuildLog.*;*.dg;*.#*;*.o

  ...except for can.obj, turntable.obj, and other actual model files!

  [FYI you can paste the above string into Windows find...]

  Also search for directories called VTune, Release and Debug, and remove them too.

  Also search for files greater than 50k and make sure there's nothing that
  doesn't belong.

* Copy the top-level directory (should be called chai3d) to a
  temporary directory.  This is just for the purpose of removing
  CVS directories, so if your archive program is smart enough
  to let you exlcude */CVS, */CVS/*, */CVS/*/*, etc., you can skip
  this.

* Remove all CVS directories (again using Windows find) from your
  temporary CHAI dir.

* Zip the top-level directory (should be called chai3d) up into
  chai3d[vx.xx].zip .  The zipfile should be around 29MB.  Be sure to
  exclude directories called "CVS" when you zip.

* Nuke your temporary CHAI dir.

* ftp the zipfile to the CHAI 'builds' directory

* Remove the entire doc/html directory online and upload the new doxygen docs.

* Edit the chai3d.html file to include all the important notes in
  the changelog since the last release.

* Check everything into CVS so everyone else can access the current CHAI via
  CVS.

* E-mail the rest of the team so we can go online and confirm that everything
  works.  It's very likely that something will be wrong, which is why everyone
  should check up on it ASAP.
