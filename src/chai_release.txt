To release a version of chai:

* Make sure that the changelog is appropriately up-to-date

* Open the msvc7 solution file and build.  Make sure that
  you're building a release version.

* Open the msvc6 workspace file and build.  Make sure that
  you're building a release version.

* Open the msvc7 example solution file and do a batch build.
  All the release versions should be selected.

* Open the msvc6 example solution file and do a batch build.
  All the release versions should be selected.

* Open the Borland example file and do a 'build all' (not 'make
  all').  This includes all the CHAI lib files.

* Close your IDE's.

* Test all the binaries if this is going to be a 'stable' release.
  This step gets skipped for a 'beta' release.

* Open doxygen and load the doc/doxyfile.  Run doxygen.  You can usually
  skip this for a 'beta' release also.

* Use windows search to find all files with these extensions and remove
  them:

  *.pch;*.obj;*.idb;*.pdb;*.tds;

  Also search for files greater than 50k and make sure there's nothing that
  doesn't belong.

* Zip the top-level directory (should be called chai3d) up into
  chai3d[vx.xx].zip

* Open the zipfile and remove 'chai_todo.txt' from the source directory; this
  contains internal todo's that the world doesn't need to see.

* Ftp the zipfile to the CHAI 'builds' directory

* Edit the main html file

* Check everything into CVS so everyone else can access the current CHAI via
  CVS.
