Rather than enumerate the format of every possible line you might write in
C++, I'll try to point out specific aspects of the CHAI coding conventions
that might not be considered 'standard' C++ style.  And of course, the best reference is the code itself; if you start from an existing CHAI file as a stencil, you'll find it hard _not_ to stick to the conventions.<p>

<a name="whitespace">
<p><hr>
<b>Whitespace and indents</b>
<hr><p>

<ul>
<li>Tabs and indents shoud be _four_ spaces... and NO TABS!  Even if your
tabstops in your favorite editor are set to four spaces, Jimbo's might not
be, so use spaces, not tabs.<p>

<li>Other than one-line functions in header files, function bodies should be
delimited by a bracket appearing on the line _after_ the function name, and
the function body should be indented two spaces.  The same convention applies
to conditional statements and loops... e.g.:<br>

<pre><tt>void cGenericObject::onDisplayReset(const bool a_affectChildren)
{
    // Forward this call to my children...

    // update children
    if (a_affectChildren)
    {
        for (unsigned int i=0; i&lt;m_children.size(); i++)
        {
            m_children[i]-&gt;onDisplayReset(true);
        }
    }
} // void onDisplayReset(...)
</tt></pre>

<li>Wherever it might not be obvious what a closing bracket means (e.g. because
it's the end of a long function and the function name is probably a page or
more away), include a one-line comment after the closing bracket... this really
helps when loops are heavily nested.  The above example is clearly unnecessary,
but it illustrates the point.<p>

<li>Skip two lines between the end of one function and the start of another;
this prevents files from getting crazy-crammed and makes it easier to quickly
scan through code.

</ul>

<a name="symbols">
<hr>
<b>File, class, variable, and function names</b>
<hr><p>
<ul>
<li>All symbols should start new words with a captial letter, e.g.
<tt>selectedObject</tt>
<li>Class names always begin with a lowercase 'c' followed by a capital
letter, e.g. <tt>cCamera</tt>
<li>The files that define the class cObject are typically called CObject.h
and CObject.cpp (with capital C's)
<li>Function parameter names begin with <tt>a_</tt>, followed by a lowercase
letter, e.g. <tt>a_selectedObject</tt>
<li>Member variable names begin with <tt>m_</tt>, followed by a lowercase
letter, e.g. <tt>m_myPrivateVariable</tt>
<li>Local variables and function names begin with a lowercase letter, e.g.
<tt>selectedObject</tt> or <tt>getGlobalPos(...)</tt>
<li>Functions that represent callbacks should begin with 'on', e.g.
<tt>onDisplayReset()</tt>
</ul>

<a name="comments">
<hr>
<b>Comments</b>
<hr><p>

<ul>
<li>Every file that is to be incorporated into CHAI should have the big CHAI header on it, and www.chai3d.org should always be listed as an author... it's at the top of every file, but for completeness I'm pasting it at the <a href="#header">end of this file</a>.<p>

<p>
<li>All inline comments (comments you sprinkle in your code, as opposed to function or file header comments) should use C++-type comments... i.e. '//' comments, not '/*' comments.  So a multi-line comment should look like this:

<pre><tt>// I'm using a lot of words right now
// to tell you that I'm incrementing
// a variable called 'i'...
i++;
</tt></pre>

<li>We use doxygen, so we need to mark header comments in the doxygen-ish
style.  Every function gets one "brief" description and one "long"
description... we typically put a brief description before a function
declaration (in a header file) and a long description before a function
definition (in a .cpp file).<p>

Brief descriptions should look like this:

<pre><tt>//! Set the local position of this object
inline void setPos(const cVector3d& a_pos) { m_localPos = a_pos; }
</tt></pre>

...and cannot exceed one line (otherwise doxygen treats them as long descriptions).<p>

Long descriptions look like this:
<pre><tt>//===========================================================================
/*!
    Create a new vertex and add it to the vertex list.

    \fn         unsigned int cMesh::newVertex(const double a_x, const double
                a_y, const double a_z)
    \param      a_x  X coordinate of vertex.
    \param      a_y  Y coordinate of vertex.
    \param      a_z  Z coordinate of vertex.
    \return     Return index position of new vertex.
*/
//===========================================================================
unsigned int cMesh::newVertex(const double a_x, const double a_y, const double a_z)
{
...
</tt></pre>

Note the exclamation point, which tells doxygen that a description is coming.  Also note the \fn tag to delimit the function name, the \param tag to delimit parameters, and the \return tag to delimit return values.<p>

<li>Similarly, each class should have an associated doxygen description wherever it's declared, a la:
<pre><tt>//===========================================================================
/*!
      \class      cCamera
      \brief      cCamera describes a virtual Camera located inside the world.
                  Its job in life is to set up the OpenGL projection matrix
                  for the current OpenGL rendering context...
*/
//===========================================================================
</tt></pre>
 
</ul>
<p>

<a name="headers">
<hr><b>Header files</b><hr><p>

<ul>

<li>Don't let inline or one-line functions take up tons of space... i.e., please do this:<br>
<pre><tt>//! Set the local position of this object
inline void setPos(const cVector3d& a_pos) { m_localPos = a_pos; }
</tt></pre>

Not this...

<pre><tt>//---------------------------------------
//! Set the local position of this object
//---------------------------------------
inline void setPos(const cVector3d& a_pos)
{
  m_localPos = a_pos;
}
</tt></pre>
Particularly when a lot of these functions come one after another (often set/get functions), doing the latter can make header files really difficult to read.<p>

<li>Include a blank line between each function in a header file... this makes
your headers much more readable.  Alternatively, place a blank line after a
few closely-related functions to delimit a new category of function.<p>
</ul>

<a name="tips">
<hr><b>Coding/Performance tips</b><hr><p>

<ul>
<li>Remember to declare functions inline if they hardly do anything (e.g. setPos())
<li>Remember to declare functions const if they don't modify any member variables
<li>Remember to take parameters by reference if all you're going to do is
copy them (i.e. if they're const), to avoid extra stack copies.  This is
particularly relevant for complex types being passed as parameters.
<li>Remember to declare parameters const if you don't need to modify them
<li>Always set pointers to null immediately after you delete them
<li>Remember to (almost) always declare your destructors virtual
<li>Any time you change an OpenGL state variable, be nice and put the
state back to where it was when you're finished, unless you have a specific
reason to do otherwise.  Use glGet to get the state beforehand for any state
variables you're going to futz with.  Similarly, always leave the GL matrix
mode set to modelview when you're finished with any matrix strack
manipulations you might be doing.
<li>Avoid <tt>using namespace std;</tt>, particularly in header files.  This
makes supporting multiple compilers more difficult, as difficult compilers
place different things in different namespaces.
<li>Avoid using <tt>friend</tt> and <tt>typeid</tt> wherever possible; they
make extending CHAI more difficult in most cases.
</ul>
